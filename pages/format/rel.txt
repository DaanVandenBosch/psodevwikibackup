====== REL File Format ======

REL is a container format with a main body, followed by the main trailer. It has many sub-formats:

  * [[:format:c_rel|C REL]] for collision geometry
  * [[:format:n_rel|N REL]] for render geometry
  * [[:format:shops_rel|Shops REL]] for shops configuration

All integer values are in little endian format. Sizes are specified in bytes (octets).

See the [[:format:rel#parsing|parsing]] chapter to get started.

^Offset^Size^Type^Name^Value|
|0|main_trailer_offset|variable|main_body|Depends on sub-format|
|main_trailer_offset|main_trailer_size|Main Trailer|main_trailer| |

==== Main Trailer ====

The main trailer has a size of at least 32 bytes and contains an offset to the main data block of the main body.

The main trailer contains a variable sized block of u16 values that seems to be some sort of checksum or index of blocks. Multiplying each u16 by 4 and summing the products gives the same value as the value located at the main block offset.

^Calculated Value^Calculation^Description|
|main_trailer_offset (mto)|checksum_offset|The absolute main trailer offset is equal to the checksum offset|
|main_trailer_size (mts)|fcs + 32| |
|checksum_padding_size (cps)|16 - checksum_size % 16|Padding to make sure the full checksum size is a multiple of 16 (byte size is a multiple of 32)|
|full_checksum_size (fcs)|ceil(checksum_size / 16) * 16|checksum_size + checksum_padding_size|

^Offset^Size^Type^Name^Value|
|0|2*cs|u16[cs]|checksum| |
|2*cs|2*cps|u16[cps]|checksum_padding|0,…|
|2*fcs|4|u32|checksum_offset|Absolute offset to a checksum of the value at the main block offset|
|2*fcs + 4|4|u32|checksum_size (cs)|Number of u16 values in the checksum of the value at the main block offset value|
|2*fcs + 8|1|u8|unknown|1|
|2*fcs + 9|7|unknown|unknown|0,…|
|2*fcs + 16|4|u32|main_block_offset|Absolute offset to the main block|
|2*fcs + 20|12|unknown|unknown|0,…|

===== Parsing =====

To start parsing a .rel file simply read the ''main_block_offset'' (u32) at offset ''EOF - 16'' which will point to the sub-format's main block. The rest of the information int the main trailer is either redundant or isn't documented yet and doesn't seem to be important.

==== Sub-Formats and Detection ====

RELs are used for two scene formats; "C REL" which is simply a set of vertices and triangle indices, and "fmt2" or "N REL" which is a complex, multi-mesh scene with normals and textures. The game uses C RELs for collision and likely minimaps, and N RELs for renderable scenes. The format is also used for shops configuration.

N RELs have the text string ''fmt2'' at ''main_block_offset''.

It is unclear how the game behaves when a REL of the wrong format exists but has correct data.

Details of the sub-formats are on separate pages, see [[:format:c_rel|C REL]], [[:format:n_rel|N REL]] and [[:format:shops_rel|Shops REL]].

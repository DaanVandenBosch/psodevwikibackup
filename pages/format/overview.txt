====== Overview of File Formats ======

Phantasy Star Online started on the Dreamcast and was subsequently ported to the Gamecube for Episodes 1&2. The Gamecube version of Episode 1&2 was later ported to the Xbox. The Xbox version was then used as the base for PsoBB.

Rel files (.rel) are a container format, that include a table of pointers to groups of assets included as structures which are shared with other formats without headers or footers. As such, while the general format is the same in most cases, having a pointer to the list of assets located at EOF -16, each use case of the rel format has a specific set of structs for its indented implementation and these implementations are described in their own respective pages.

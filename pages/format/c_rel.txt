====== C REL File Format ======

This sub format describes geometrical data used for collision detection. The data is split up in 0 or more blocks of arbitrary size. The data block offsets can be found in the main offset table which is located at an offset located at main_block_offset.

A right-handed coordinate system is used as in OpenGL where x goes from left to right, y goes from down to up and z goes in the opposite direction of the camera’s direction.

===== Vector =====

Fixed-size structure of 12 bytes used throughout the format.

^Offset^Size^Type^Name^Value|
|0|4|f32|x| |
|4|4|f32|y| |
|8|4|f32|z| |

===== Main Block =====

The variably sized main block simply points to the main offset table, located at main_block_offset.

^ Offset ^ Size ^ Type ^ Name ^ Value ^
| 0 | 4 | u32 | main_offset_table_offset | Absolute offset to the main offset table |
| 4 | unknown | unknown | unknown | 0,… |

===== Main Offset Table =====

^ Offset ^ Size ^ Type ^ Name ^ Value ^
| 0 | main_offset_table_size | Main Offset Table Entry [] | main_offset_table_body | |

===== Main Offset Table Entry =====

Fixed-size structure of 24 bytes. Entries in the main offset table point to the start of a block trailer.

^ Offset ^ Size ^ Type ^ Name ^ Value ^
| 0 | 4 | u32 | block_trailer_offset | Absolute offset to a block trailer |
| 4 | 20 | unknown | unknown | unknown |

===== Block =====

^ Offset ^ Size ^ Type ^ Name ^ Value ^
| 0 | 12*vc | Vector [vc] | vertex_table | |
| 12*vc | 36*tc | Triangle [tc] | triangle_table | |
| 12*vc + 36*tc | 16 | Block Trailer | block_trailer | |

===== Triangle =====

Fixed-size structure of 36 bytes.

^ Offset ^ Size ^ Type ^ Name ^ Value ^
| 0 | 6 | u16[3] | vertex_index_table | Relative to the vertex table |
| 6 | 2 | u16 | flags | Contains information about the type of object this triangle belongs to |
| 8 | 12 | Vector | surface_normal | |
| 20 | 12 | Vector | triangle_center | |
| 32 | 4 | f32 | bounding_sphere_radius | Defines, together with triangle_center, the bounding sphere |

==== Flags ====

^ Bit ^ Bit Mask ^ Hex Bit Mask ^ Meaning ^
|  0 |  ''0b1'' |  ''0x1'' | Ground flag |
|  1 |  ''0b10'' |  ''0x2'' | Water/vegetation flag (used in ep. II/IV)? |
|  2 |  ''0b100'' |  ''0x4'' | Water flag? |
|  3 |  ''0b1000'' |  ''0x8'' | unknown |
|  4 |  ''0b10000'' |  ''0x10'' | Vegetation flag |
|  5 |  ''0b100000'' |  ''0x20'' | Wall flag |
|  6 |  ''0b1000000'' |  ''0x40'' | Is either part of a section and denotes a section transition (e.g. a door in Forest 1) or is part of a section that exists to separate larger sections (e.g. a bridge in Crater Interior). |
|  7 |  ''0b10000000'' |  ''0x80'' | Seemingly unused |
|  8-15 | | | unknown |

===== Block Trailer =====

Fixed-size structure of 16 bytes.

^ Offset ^ Size ^ Type ^ Name ^ Value ^
| 0 | 4 | u32 | vertex_count (vc) | |
| 4 | 4 | u32 | vertex_table_offset | Absolute offset |
| 8 | 4 | u32 | triangle_count (tc) | |
| 12 | 4 | u32 | triangle_table_offset | Absolute offset |

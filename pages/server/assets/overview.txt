===== Quests =====

==== DAT and BIN Files ====

A quest is described in a [[format:dat|.dat file]] containing enemy, object, map event data and a [[format:bin|.bin file]] containing meta data and object code which is called when certain events are triggered. These files are sent to the client in PRS-compressed form.

==== QST Container Format ====

Many server implementations choose to store the .dat and .bin file in compressed and interlaced form in a [[format:qst|.qst file]].
